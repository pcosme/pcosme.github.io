                 <h3>About me</h3>
                <p class="drop-cap" >I am a researcher at Instituto de Plasmas e Fus√£o Nuclear (Lisbon) in the Laboratory for Quantum Plasmas group.
I completed my Engineering Physics PhD in 2024, with a dissertation titled "Plasmonic Instabilities in
Bidimensional Materials". 
During my academic path, I developed  interest in the fields of plasma physics, particularly on the cross-over to condensed matter physics, nonlinear phenomena and dynamical systems.
From the early stages of my academic path, my main interests lay in complex and dynamical systems and statistical physics alike. Thus, my commitment to condensed matter and plasma physics is only natural, as those fields host an assortment of situations, that one can explore from the dynamical point of view, and where a plethora of phenomena can be found, from nonlinear interactions to complex behaviour and pattern formation. 
 </p>
                <p class="drop-cap">AT present, my research is centred on the exploration of instabilities phenomena and nonlinear waves in 2D materials; notably studying its wave instabilities as an active medium for the generation of radiation in the THz range. Bridging the fields of plasma physics and condensed matter. In particular, to model and describe the dynamic hidrodynamic regime of charge carriers and other quasi particles of 2D systems. Those scenarios display several unique properties, such as the existence of odd viscosity that leads to interesting dispersive properties and nonlinear wave responses that I have studied in the context of electronic fluids and are also present in other complex fluids. More recently, I have also found interest in topological modes in the continuum, occurring at the interfaces or edges of the 2D systems,  which can occur in magnetized systems or, equivalently, in active matter systems with inherent rotations.</p>
